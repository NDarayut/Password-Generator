# Password Generator with Tkinter  
This is a simple Python application that generates passwords based on user preferences. 
The application uses Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI) 
and allows users to select the types of characters (Alphabets, Numbers, Symbols) they want to include in the generated password.  
## Features  
- **User Interface**: A Tkinter-based GUI with checkboxes for selecting:  
  - **Alphabets** (uppercase and lowercase letters)  
  - **Numbers** (digits 0-9)  
  - **Symbols** (special characters like @, #, $, %, etc.)  
- **Customizable Password**: Users can generate passwords with a combination of the selected options or choose individual options.  
- **Copy to Clipboard**: After generating the password, it can be copied to the clipboard for easy use.
